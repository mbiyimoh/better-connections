## Details

### Import contacts from iPhone

Adding contacts just got easier on mobile. When you're on your phone creating a new contact, you'll now see an "Import a vCard" button at the top of the form.

Here's how it works:
- Open the contact in your iPhone's Contacts app
- Tap Share → Save to Files
- In Better Contacts, tap "Import a vCard" and select the file
- The contact form pre-fills with all the details

If you accidentally pick a file with multiple contacts, we'll guide you to the bulk import tool instead.

### Research progress tracking

Running AI research on a contact now shows you exactly what's happening. A visual stepper displays 6 stages:

1. Preparing search
2. Checking LinkedIn
3. Searching for sources
4. Reading through findings
5. Crafting recommendations
6. Finalizing results

Each step animates as it completes, so you always know the research is working. If you need to step away, the research continues in the background.

### Enrichment flow polish

We've made several improvements to the enrichment experience based on your feedback:

**Searchable enrichment queue** — Can't find that contact you want to enrich? Now you can search by name, email, or company right from the enrichment page.

**Prominent Enrich button** — The "Enrich" action is no longer buried in a menu. It now sits right next to the Edit button on every contact, styled in gold so you can't miss it.

**Editable tags** — Before saving your enrichment session, you can now edit any AI-suggested tag. Click the text to rename it, click the colored dot to change its category, or click X to remove it entirely.

**Continue enriching** — After completing an enrichment session, you'll see a new "Continue Enriching" button. Use it to add more context to the same contact without navigating back through the queue.

**Relationship strength tooltips** — Hover over the relationship strength indicator to see what each level means: from "Distant connection" (1) to "Close connection — trusted relationship" (4).

### M33T event platform

We're introducing M33T — a private event networking platform built on Better Contacts. M33T helps you create curated events where attendees get AI-powered match recommendations before they arrive.

**For organizers:**
- Create events with customizable questionnaires
- Import guests directly from your Better Contacts
- Review AI-generated matches and curate connections
- Add co-organizers with granular permissions
- Track RSVPs with real-time updates

**For attendees:**
- Beautiful public landing pages showcasing who's attending
- Profile modals with "why they're interesting" insights
- Trading card-style profiles with conversation starters
- Match reveals via SMS and email before the event

M33T includes a scrollytelling introduction for special events like NO EDGES, creating an immersive experience that sets the tone before guests even RSVP.

This feature is currently available by invitation only. If you're interested in hosting a M33T event, reach out to us through the feedback button.

### Other improvements

- **Pagination fixes** — The "Show more contacts" button in the enrichment queue now actually works, and your page size preference (default: 100) persists across sessions
- **Bulk duplicate handling** — When importing contacts, you can now "Skip All Remaining" or "Merge All" duplicates instead of handling them one at a time
- **Smarter mention matching** — When you mention someone during enrichment (like "Scott from Stripe"), we now use context clues to find the right contact instead of just picking alphabetically
